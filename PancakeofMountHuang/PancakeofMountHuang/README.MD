# Introduction about this Eclipse Project #
This is a subproject of all program named after 'dawn'.  

In this eclipse project, we will focus on function of data pre-process. We will analyze, design and implement a series of modules includes but not all included: Users' Security, Upload, Data On-time review, Interfaces of Data Pre-process, Simple implementation of Interfaces of Data Pre-process.


# Ideas about implementation of the Interfaces
1. use blank/Average to fill irregular values
2. use matrix(also we called as vectorizing) to enhance the performance
3. use matrix to devide regular values and irregular values to enhance process effeciency.
4. use Nerual Networks to solve irregular values more precisely.
